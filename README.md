# Molecular-Dynamics
To track the movement of different types of molecules. 

I wanted to create several molecules of different types and track their movements using numpy and matlab. 

I have already created Particle, Immobile Particle, Partially Bound Particle, and a Black Hole particle. 

I hope to make these particles eventually interact with each other and with their environment, but as of now I have not been 
able to do so. 

I aim to use GitHub to help me find other similar projects and learn how to do some of the more complex things I aim to 
add to this project, such as a collision checker, some kind of force interaction between particles, and some new, more complex
types of particles.
